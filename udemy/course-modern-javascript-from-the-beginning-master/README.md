# [Course - Modern Javascript from Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning)

This repository is a place where i store all the files used in this course and can assist as consultation for commands and patterns.

The course explains how to code in javascript from with new concepts from ES6+, where all the examples are great and explain straight to the point, i really recomend this course for people that have a minimal knowledge in javascript and want to understand old and new javascript code and patterns.
